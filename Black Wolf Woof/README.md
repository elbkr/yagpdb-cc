## News  

Almost everything that is on my website will now be moved to this repository if not already here.  
On my [discord server](https://discord.gg/GRns3fg) there is now a designated section for YAGPDB. There you can find updates for my custom commands, other GitHub repositories from the community and a small support / discussion channel.  
So if you are looking for new custom commands take a look ;) there

## Introduction

## Other custom command repositories

[Official Repo](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc): The official custom command repository. If you are searching for more custom commands you will find a lot of them there :).  
[Pedro's Repo](https://github.com/Pedro-Pessoa/yagpdb-cc/tree/Tickets/tickets): A fork of the official repo but with an amazing ticket system.
  
There are way more repositories that have custom command codes, but they are not official. If you are looking for them just look for `yagpdb-cc` on GitHub. We will not guarantee that the other user repositories are safe to use.

## License  

You do not have to include [the full license](https://github.com/BlackWolfWoof/yagpdb-cc/blob/master/LICENSE) in the code because it is too long. That's why I made [this small text](#small-license-text) that has to stay in the code if it is found there.  
If [that license](#small-license-text) can not be found on the code in this repository, you can do whatever you want with the code.
