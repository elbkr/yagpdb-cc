{{/*
	Usage:
	This template is for advanced users that know what they are doing.
	It can be used to for example get all entries from a specific database key without hitting some limits that you can reset via using execCC.
	In the pre-made code you will get 10 entries from the key "test" every time it runs.

	Code Example: A working code example with no additional setup can be found at https://github.com/BlackWolfWoof/yagpdb-cc/blob/master/Templates/bypass%20limit%20example.gotmpl
