# Database Manipulation
  
Hello, thanks for using my database custom commands.  
  
There are 3 folders inside of this one.  
Basic - All database commands you need for things like dbset dbdel  
dbreset - All database commands that do mass deletion of entries  
dbmap - All database commands that have to do with saved sdicts in the dbvalue  
  
  
### Small info:  
The custom commands such as dbget and dbgetmap use your timezone from yagpdb. To make sure you have set the right timezone run `setz <Area/City>` and select your [timezone here](https://kevinnovak.github.io/Time-Zone-Picker/) and paste it into the area/city part in the command.  
  
### What you can change:  
In all custom commands, there might be a few variables you can change at the top of each command such as the timezone and permissions.  
  
### What are dbmaps?  
If you like saving stuff in the database you might run across sdict and that you can save stuff via {{dbSet 1234 "test" (sdict "tree" "big"   "house" "huge" "your mum" "gay")}}. Now you can use `dballmap 1234 test` to view all available names like `tree` `house` and `your mum`.   
  
### What does reset do?  
With the reset custom commands, you can mass delete database entries. There will be a confirmation so you don't accidentally delete shit.
