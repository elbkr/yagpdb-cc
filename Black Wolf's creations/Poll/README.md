## What is so special about this custom command?
When adding `-single` anywhere in the trigger you can force people to only choose one reaction and whenever a user reacts on 2 reactions his old reaction will be removed.

## ❗DISCLAMER❗
Due to the reaction part of the code having a huge anti spam part to prevent people from spam clicking the reactions and crashing the custom command yagpdb, it will wait before removing multiple emojis the user reacted to.
