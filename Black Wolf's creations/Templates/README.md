### Permission Check  

This code can be used to check if a user has the right permissions to execute the custom command. Here a little preview of how it can look with my database custom commands:

#### v1  

Checks if a user has the permission `$perms` and if they don't send an error message.  

#### v2  

Use this if you have multiple permissions you want to check. $perms is a slice of all permissions the user has.  

#### different channel  

Use this if you want to see if a user has the permission `$perms` in the channel with the ID `$channelID`.

### RoleColor  

Get the top color that a member has on your server. That is also the color that his name will appear in chat. Can for example be used to auto color embeds if a user talks.
