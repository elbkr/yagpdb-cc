## Notes
- This was made as an example of how a wait response system would work, thus why it shows multiple examples but does not show for any precise usage.

## Thing Included
- Nice user interface
- Message to let the user know their tutorial has timed out
- Allows for user to input data
- Lots of comments to make it easy to learn
- Shows examples of 3 different ways to grab data from the user, an integer, a string with requirements and an exact match
- Error messages
- If there is no response after 60s, tutorial is cancelled
- Type "cancel" to stop your tutorial at any time
- Embed colour is changed to the highest role with a colour, if none, defaults to green
