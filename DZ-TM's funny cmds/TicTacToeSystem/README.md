## Consists Of:
- Two players 3x3 TicTacToe games.
- Checks for a winner or draw.
- Everything is set up for you, easy to customise if necessary.

## Configuration Rules:
- Ensure that YAGPDB.xyz has access to the emojis - bots have the same powers as Nitro users regarding emotes. Click [here]( https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036479811-Custom-Emojis ) for more information.
- Errors will be displayed in scenarios where the customisable embed object is inputted incorrectly, please read [this]( https://docs.yagpdb.xyz/others/custom-embeds#embeds-in-custom-commands ) if you do not know how to edit it correctly.

## Known Errors:
- Deleting the message before YAGPDB.xyz has added all the emotes results in an error, this can be slightly fixed but the workaround is expensive and ineffective so it's recommended to simply disable error messages.
- If you do not input unique emotes for the configuration aspect of the code, it will appear very odd. (e.g. both players are "‚ùå") Fix: ensure that all emojis are visually and technically unique.
- Incorrect embed formatting. Fix: read [here]( https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036479811-Custom-Emojis ) on proper embed formatting.
- Non-existent emotes or does not have access to an emote. Fix: check that the input is correct and that YAGPDB.xyz has a server connecting it and the emote.
