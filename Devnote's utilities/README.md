## Available Custom Commands:
<details>
  <summary>Custom Mute CC</summary>
  <br>
  A selective channel mute custom command that works just like it sounds. It can be edited to also send messages in Mod-Log channels when used.
  <strong>Note:</strong> this CC is no longer supported as there are more efficient versions of this code. Eventually, when there are more CCs added to this repository, this custom command will be removed.
