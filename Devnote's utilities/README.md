**I am currently taking requests for CCs to add to this repository!** See [Contributing](#Contributing) for more info.

Sorry I haven't been maintaining this repo recently, I've been busy developing a bot with some friends, feel free to check it out below under [links](#links)! We're working really hard on it and appreciate any support! There will be CC updates for the repo coming shortly!!

## Recent Updates:
- Rework of some CCs

## Available Custom Commands:
<details>
  <summary>Custom Mute CC</summary>
  <br>
  A selective channel mute custom command that works just like it sounds. It can be edited to also send messages in Mod-Log channels when used.
