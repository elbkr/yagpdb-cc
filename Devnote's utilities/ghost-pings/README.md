# Ghost-Ping Detector CC

The custom commands for this CC group are purposefully made to be interchangeable (basically you are free to edit parts of the code if you are experienced with YAGPDB code). If you choose to do so, please keep the credits in the CC. Thanks :)

Features | V1 | V2
---------|----|----
Double `exec` check for ghost-ping | ✅ | ✅
Responds with message author and pinged users | ✅ | ✅
Reposts original message content | ❌ | ✅
Posts message logs with content (lag precaution) | ❌ | ✅
Embed format because why not ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ | ❌ | ✅

**Note:** When setting up the custom command, make sure that you only change the content after the `$variable :=` not that part. Example: `$ping := false` can be changed to `$ping := true`, but **not** `$pingtrue := false` - this will break the CC.

*If you find any bugs or issues, feel free to PR an issue or fix, or contact me through the YAGPDB Support Server*
