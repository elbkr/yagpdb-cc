## Other Info
The new `-j` flag for formatting is still being tested, the regex for it may be altered in future versions.

Join and boost messages from the server/Discord have no content and are not always recognised as it's designated type. I presume this is a Discord bug as it has worked for some users, so it may be fixed when **API v8** is released. Reply messages still identify as TYPE0, however the Discord Developers documentation was updated showing that reply messages will go under it's own type, TYPE19, when **API v8** is released. Until then, the code for reply messages will stay put, then when the new API rolls out, it should work flawlessly.
