## Adding these custom commands

This assumes you know how to create a custom command, if you aren't too familiar with that or just need a refresher, [this article](https://learn.yagpdb.xyz/the-custom-command-interface) explains it well.

The **yagpdb-cc** repository is separated into groups / categories. Most categories have standalone custom commands, meaning you can add one, two, or even all of them without issues. There are, however, some "systems" which require you to add all commands in that section. This is detailed in the individual `README.md` of that section.

When you find a custom command you wish to add, the file will have a leading comment explaining what it does and the recommended trigger type & trigger value. You can add it in the YAGPDB dashboard with these attributes.

## Contributing

If you spot an error, feel free to make a PR or open an issue.
If you wish to add your own command, feel free to make a PR as well. Note that not all CCs PRed will be added; merging is up to maintainers. Don't take it personally if your PR didn't make it through - we only accept custom commands that we feel will be useful to many people.

_If you are adding a new CC, please read the [guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md). We don't have too many hard-and-fast conventions in place other than some about documentation_.

## Disclaimer

The YAGPDB developer, staff, and/or support are not responsible for any difficulties caused by these custom commands.
These commands are not guaranteed to be working, use them at your own risk.
