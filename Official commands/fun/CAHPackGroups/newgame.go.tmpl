{{/*
	This command starts a new CAH game using the specified packs and pack groups.
	It first checks whether each argument is a valid pack group and, if so, expands it into its component packs. If not, that argment is assumed to be an individual pack and is skipped. After expanding all applicable pack groups, the resulting list of packs is used to start a new game, and all members with the CAH role are pinged.

	Usage: `-newgame pack1 "pack 2" packGroup1 "pack group 2" etc` (no specific ordering necessary)

	Recommended trigger: `newgame`
	Trigger type: Command
