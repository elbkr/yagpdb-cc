# Giveaway Package (Basic Version 2)

This is a giveaway package for YAGPDB bot consisting of 2 Custom Commands (CCs).
Both must be saved for it to work as expected.

## Sub-Commands (precede all commands by the prefix for YOUR server to invoke them):

1.  **giveaway start \<Time\> \<Prize\>**

    Use: To start a new giveaway.

    - **\<Time\>** It is specified as the amount of time after which giveaway winners will be announced or how long giveaway will be active.
      Format is (num)y(num)mo(num)w(num)d(num)h(num)m(num)s.

                        eg: 1y7mo2w1d3h4m15s = 1 year 7 months 2 weeks 1 day 3 hours 4 minutes and 15 seconds.

      _Note :_ must not contain spaces in between and use the mentioned format only i.e d not days for specifying days so on.

    - **\<Prize\>** A string which will contain the prize of the giveaway , can be multiple words.

    - **Optional Flags**

      | Flag |    Argument Type     |                                        Usage                                        |
      | ---- | :------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
      | -p   |        number        |          for specifying max number of participants( default is unlimited).          |
      | -w   |        number        |                  for specifying number of winners ( default is 1)                   |
      | -c   | Channel (ID/Mention) | for specifying the channel for giveaway to take place ( default is current channel) |

    **Example:** `(prefix)giveaway start 1d12h Ps4 Pro -p 50 -w 2 -c #giveaway-channel` will start a giveaway in the #giveaway-channel which will remain active for 1 day 12 hours with max participants as 50 and max winners as 2.

2.  **giveaway end \<ID\>**

    Ends a giveaway with specified ID and will announce the winners instantly. Will update giveaway announcement message.

    _Note:_ ID is the long number which can be obtained using: `g list` command and is also mentioned in the giveaway announcement embed.

3.  **giveaway cancel \<ID\>**

    Cancels a giveaway with specified ID WITHOUT announcing winners. Will update giveaway announcement message.

    _Note:_ ID is the long number which can be obtained using: `g list` command and is also mentioned in the giveaway announcement embed.

4.  **giveaway reroll [ID or N Giveaways Old]**

    Re-rolls an old giveaway, which was finished earlier, to find new winner(s). If no argument is passed, the most recently finished giveaway is re-rolled.

    Accpets an optional argument which could be either the ID of the older giveaway or you can specify the nth previously finished giveaway (between 1 - 10).

    For example, if 2 is passed, it will re-roll the giveaway finished before the most recently finished giveaway.

5.  **giveaway list**

    Lists all active giveaways with their IDs , Prize and Ending Time.

## ExecCC support:

Code has inbuilt intuitive execCC support. ExecData for invoking command via execCC is simply :

    "giveaway <Sub_Command> <argument_1> <argument_2> ..."

Examples:

- `{{execCC $CCID_for_giveaway_cc nil 0 "-giveaway start 1d Coins -w 2"}}` is equivalent to : `-giveaway start 1d Coins`

  Above will start a giveaway in the same channel in which execCC is invoked with a duration of 1 day with max winners: 2 and prize: Coins

- `{{execCC $CCID_for_giveaway_cc nil 0 "-givewaway end 11106339"}}` is equivalent to : `-giveaway end 11106339`

  Above will end the giveaway with ID = `11106339` immediately and announce the winners.

So in general you can pass the ExecData as simply trigger followed by Sub-Command and arguments separated by a space " " all joined into a single string.

## Inbuilt syntax displayer:

The main command also has an inbuilt syntax displayer which can be invoked by simply typing the trigger without any arguments.

## Things which can be modified:

The giveaway emoji is present as the Top of both commands and can be modified according to choice but remember!! needs to be modified for both commands (CCs).
