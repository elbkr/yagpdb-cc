# Report System
The very first version features basic tracking and notifications.

### Installing 
Before you continue to read further, please take your time to read the leading comment in each custom command script.<br/>
The [main command](customReport.go.tmpl "main command") has a configuration area. Please note this short explanation on each variable:

* The report log is the channel where the reports are being sent to.
* Report-Discussion is the channel where users are being notified of updates regarding their report.

---
As you might have already seen, I noted down the trigger and trigger type in the leading comment in each file.<br/>
These are important - they'll allow you to use aliases such as `report`, `reportuser`, `ru`; `cancel`, `cancelreport`, `cr`; respectively. If you do not wish to use aliases, then make sure you choose a command trigger and one single command name - the command trigger type does not allow for multiple triggers, hence the usage of a RegEx trigger type.

This goes for all kind of information: The usage, trigger, trigger type, and a short description as well as license and author are all noted down in the heading comment, so reading it can save you quite a lot of troubleshooting.

Navigate to your [control panel](https://yagpdb.xyz/manage "YAGPDB.xyz control panel") and select the server you want to add this package to. Make sure you are logged into the right account.<br/>
First off, navigate on your control panel to **Tools & Utilities > Moderation** and select the **General** tab. Find the switch labelled **Enable report command?** and confirm that it is off (it will turn red when that is the case). For a visual reference, take a look at the following screenshot:

###### Disabled report command:

Now navigate to **Core > Command settings** and select the **Global** tab. We are going to create a new command override affecting the report command. Select this command in the dropdown and hit the switch **Enable specified commands?** so that it turns red. You'll find a visual reference as the following screenshot:

| --- |

Navigate to **Core > Custom commands**. If you want to keep it all neat and organised, create a new category called "Report System" or similar, just so that you know what kind of commands are in there.<br/>
Copy the code and create for each file a new custom command. Look at the leading comment and set up the trigger type and trigger accordingly.<br/>
As a final step on the control panel, exchange `CHANNEL-ID` for the according channel ID of your report log as well as your report-discussion.

Navigate back to Discord and run `-ru dbSetup`. Please note that this sub-command is case sensitive. Upon success, YAGPDB will respond with 
> Database primed, report numbers reset, system is ready to use!

| ✅ Your report-system is now set up! |

#### Colour 
There are several states a report can be in, and each one has an individual colour. This will make it easier for you and your staff to see which report needs the most attention (also everybody likes a little colour):
