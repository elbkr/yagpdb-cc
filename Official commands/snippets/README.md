# Code Snippets

This is a collection of useful "snippets", or parts of code, that you can implement. For example, this folder includes converting a string to time, implemention of selection sort, etc.

**Note:** Most code in this folder cannot be copy-pasted. It is here for you to understand and use in your own code. Do not expect to be able to copy-paste this.
