# Suggestion Systems

An integrated Suggetion System with all commands condensed into a Single CC. This is similar to the current system in use in YAGPDB Server.

## Trigger

### Type - Regex

### Trigger -

    (?i)\A(\-\s?|<@!?204255221017214977>\s*)((del(ete)?|edit)?suggest(ion)?|(sa|suggestadmin)\s+((?:mark)?dupe|deny|implement(ed)?|archive|approved?|comment))(\s+|\z)

| ‚ö† If your prefix is not `-` replace the `-` at the start of the trigger with your prefix. |
| --- |

Example - For a server with prefix - `?`, Trigger would be : `(?i)\A(\?\s?|<@!?204255221017214977>\s*)((del(ete)?|edit)?suggest(ion)?|(sa|suggestadmin)\s+((?:mark)?dupe|deny|implement(ed)?|archive|approved?|comment))(\s+|\z)`

# Configuration Variables

1. `$Suggestion_Channel` -

   The channel where the suggestions are sent.

2. `$Logging_Channel` -

   The channel where messages regarding denied/approved/implemented and suggestions marked as dupe are sent. It is suggested to keep it separate from the $Suggestion_Channel to reduce clutter but depends on personal taste.

3. `$Implemented_Channel` -

   The channel where suggestions which have been marked as implemented are sent. This provides a good way to organise all implemented suggestions into a separate channel.

4. `$Approved_Channel` -

   The channel where suggestions which have been marked as approved are sent. This provides a good way to organise all approved suggestions. This provides a good way to organise all implemented suggestions into a separate channel. It is very much possible to set the same channel for tracking approved+implemented suggestions by using the same channel ID in both variables.

| ‚Ñπ Among the **above** variables all channels can be separate or same. All combinations are possible. |
| --- |

| üõë DO NOT LEAVE ANY CHANNEL ID AS BLANK. YOU CAN PUT ALL IDS SAME BUT NEVER LEAVE THEM BLANK! |
| --- |

5. `$Mod_Roles` -

   List of all role ids of moderators who should have access to all the suggestadmin commands. You do no need to specify roles who have `administrator` permissions in your server. They will have access by default.

6. `$Cooldown` -

   Cooldown in seconds between consecutive suggestions. This prevents suggestion misuse/spam. Can be set to 0 to disable. Mods/Admins can bypass the cooldown.

7. `$Upvote` -

   Upvote reaction emoji to use; inbuilt and custom emojis are both supported. If using a custom emoji, use the `name:id` / `a:name:id` format (for animated emojis). Otherwise, use the corresponding Unicode character, for example, `üëç`.

8. `$Downvote` -

   Downvote reaction emoji to use; inbuilt and custom emojis are both supported. If using a custom emoji, use the `name:id` / `a:name:id` format (for animated emojis). Otherwise, use the corresponding Unicode character, for example, `üëç`.

| ‚Ñπ When using unicode (inbuilt) emoji, make sure your code looks like the following: |
| --- |

```go
{{$Upvote:="üëç"}}
{{$Downvote:="üëé"}}
```
