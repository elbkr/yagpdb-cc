{{/*
    This custom commands functions similar to the reminder command, however it will send a DM instantly.
    One could say like a private pin command. Nothing much, but quite handy I think  :)

    Usage:  
        Bookmark <message>
        bm <message>
    
    Recommended trigger and trigger type: RegEx trigger with `\A(?:-\s?|<@!?204255221017214977>\s*)b(?:ook)?m(?:ark)?(?:\s+|\z)`
