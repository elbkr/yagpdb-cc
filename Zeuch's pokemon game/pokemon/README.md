You'll have 10 seconds to enter the pokémon's name, or you'll fail the question.  To answer it, just type the name of the pokémon (no `-` or anything).  You'll receive a response similar to these:

If you run out of time, you'll see this:

## Negative effects:

1. Requires 3 database entries (only 1 is permanent, the other 2 are deleted when an answer is correct or time runs out)
1. (currently) Does not support generation 8 pokémon
1. Some pokémon may be spelt incorrectly, leading to a correct answer being registered as incorrect.
